**MemoryBridge** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives every AI coding tool you use — **Claude Code, Cursor, Google Antigravity, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Continue.dev, VS Code Copilot, Claude Desktop** — a shared memory of your project. One Markdown file (`.ai-memory.md`) lives in your project folder. Every AI tool reads it on session start. You stop re-explaining your stack, decisions, and known bugs every time you start a new chat.

**Why it matters:** developers on $20/month AI plans burn through their quota re-pasting project context. MemoryBridge cuts that overhead by **~94% on input tokens** and **up to 75% on output tokens** (with the built-in response-style toggle). On a Sonnet-class model at heavy usage, that's $50–$100/month back in your pocket.

## ⚡ Quick install

```bash
npx memorybridge init
```

That's it. The installer auto-detects your AI tools and wires `memorybridge` into each one's MCP config. Restart your AI tool and you're done.

> Currently you can run from source while we finalize the npm publish. See [Manual install](#manual-install-while-we-publish).

## 🎯 The problem MemoryBridge solves

Every AI tool forgets your project the moment a session ends:

- **Vibe coders** re-paste "this is a Next.js app using Supabase…" every single session
- **Pros switching between Claude Code and Cursor** start over from zero each time
- **Teams** lose architecture decisions because nothing remembers them between hires
- **Users on cheaper plans** burn their token quota explaining context the AI already heard yesterday

21+ frameworks exist to solve this. None work across every tool, are free, and small enough to run locally. MemoryBridge is.

## ✨ What you get

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Cross-tool memory** | One `.ai-memory.md` file works in Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and any MCP-compatible AI |
| ⚡ **Token frugality** | Default `memory_load` returns ~400 tokens (vs Mem0's typical 2,000–5,000) |
| 🎚 **Response-length toggle** | 5 levels — ultra-terse to verbose — controls AI output size, your biggest $-saver |
| 📁 **Project-local file** | Memory lives in your project folder, travels with your repo, can be Git-versioned for team sharing |
| 🛡️ **Safe writes** | Banner + SHA-1 hash protection — refuses to overwrite hand-written `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`.cursorrules` |
| ↩️ **Memory undo** | Every save is snapshotted. `memorybridge undo` rolls back. No git dependency. |
| 🔀 **Universal emitter** | Generate `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `GEMINI.md`, `.continuerules`, Copilot instructions — all from one source |
| 🔍 **Cross-project search** | `memorybridge global-search "supabase"` searches every indexed project at once |
| 📊 **Real savings dashboard** | `memorybridge savings` shows actual measured tokens served + dollar estimates per tier |
| 🗺️ **Symbol extraction** | `memorybridge symbols save` extracts exports from JS/TS/Py/Go so AI doesn't re-grep |
| 🔒 **Zero cloud, zero accounts** | Everything is a local file. No telemetry. No vendor lock-in. |
| ↪️ **Clean uninstall** | `memorybridge uninstall` cleanly reverses everything |

## 🚀 60-second walkthrough

```bash
# 1. Install (auto-detects Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, etc.)
npx memorybridge init

# 2. See everything in one dashboard
memorybridge settings

# 3. Use any AI tool in any project. When you say "I prefer TypeScript strict mode",
#    the AI calls memory_save automatically. Next session, it already knows.

# 4. Make AI responses shorter to save output tokens (5× cost vs input)
memorybridge shorter

# 5. Watch real savings accumulate
memorybridge savings

# 6. Generate AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules — all from one source
memorybridge emit --all

# 7. Search across every project you've ever worked on
memorybridge global-search "supabase"

# 8. Roll back a bad memory save
memorybridge undo
```

## 📊 Real token savings (measured)

After 7 calls in a test project:

```
INPUT token savings (vs. re-pasting ~3,000 tokens of context per session):
  Baseline:        21,000 tokens
  Actual served:   1,405 tokens
  Saved:           19,595 tokens (93%)

OUTPUT token savings (style level 2 — concise):
  Estimated saved: 2,640 tokens (55%)
```

At 500 sessions/month on Sonnet, you save roughly **$6.50/month**. At 100 sessions on Opus you save **$3.40/month**. Heavy users on Opus see **$23+/month**. Run `memorybridge compare --sessions 500` to see your projected savings.

> **Honest disclaimer:** "Tokens saved" assumes a 3,000-token re-paste baseline per session. If you don't re-paste, savings are smaller. If you re-paste more, savings are larger. Tokens *served* (1,405 above) are real, measured by `gpt-tokenizer` on the actual returned text.

## ❓ FAQ

### Will this actually save me tokens?

Yes, if (a) you currently re-paste project context across sessions, (b) you use AI tools regularly, and (c) the AI calls `memory_load` (it does, automatically, when MemoryBridge is configured). The savings are real for most coding workflows. They are zero if you don't re-paste at all. See [the savings section](#-real-token-savings-measured) above for the honest math.

### Will it break my project?

No. We never modify your source code. We refuse to overwrite hand-written files (banner + hash check). Every memory write is snapshotted for `memorybridge undo`. The full safety contract is in [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md).

### What AI tools does it work with?

Any AI tool that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). Currently auto-detected: Claude Code, Cursor, Google Antigravity, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Continue.dev, VS Code (+ Copilot), Claude Desktop, OpenCode. More will work as MCP adoption grows.

### Where is my data stored?

- Per-project memory: `<your-project>/.ai-memory.md` — in your project folder
- Global preferences + history: `~/.memorybridge/` — your home directory
- Override with the `MEMORYBRIDGE_PATH` environment variable

Nothing leaves your machine. Zero cloud. Zero accounts. Zero telemetry.

### How does it compare to Mem0?

Mem0 uses an LLM to extract memories into a vector DB. Powerful but heavy: requires Docker, vector store setup, an LLM API key, and per [their own audit](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/issues/4573) produces ~97% junk memories. MemoryBridge is the opposite: explicit saves, plain markdown, no DB, no LLM extraction, < 60 second install.

### How does it compare to CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md?

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are static files you write by hand and one tool reads. MemoryBridge lets the AI write to and read from a single source of truth, then can **emit** all those formats automatically (`memorybridge emit --all`). One source. Every format.

### What about ChatGPT memory?

ChatGPT memory is invisible (you can't see what's stored), single-tool (doesn't work in Claude/Cursor), and cloud-only (your data goes to OpenAI's servers). MemoryBridge is human-readable, cross-tool, and local.

### Will it work on my OS?

Yes — Windows, macOS, Linux. We test on Node 20+.

### Is it open source?

Yes — MIT licensed. Contributions welcome.

### What's the future roadmap?

See [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md) and [WHY_AND_HOW.md](WHY_AND_HOW.md) for the full plan and research findings.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome. Good first issues:

- Adding new AI tool detection paths (we currently detect 9 — there are more)
- Adding emit formats for new tools (e.g. JetBrains AI when MCP support lands)
- Improving symbol extraction patterns (especially Python and Go)
- Writing tests
- Translating the CLI output

Open an issue first if you're planning a big change.

---

## 🔒 Safety

Read the full safety contract: [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md). TL;DR: we only ever write to `.ai-memory.md`, `.ai-memory.archive.md`, the optional emitted files (with banner protection), and `~/.memorybridge/`. We never touch your source code. Uninstall is a single command and fully reversible.

## 🧪 Manual install (while we publish to npm)
